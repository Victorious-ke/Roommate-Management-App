/** Purpose: This component would display a list of events, such as grocery shopping trips, house dinners, or other scheduled activities. You could show details like the event title, a brief description, the creator's name, and the list of participants. This component could be part of a separate route, 
 * for example, /events, to keep your application organized.* 
 */
/** Database Interaction:
GET /events: This component would fetch the list of all events from the database.
GET /roommates: To display the names of the createdBy roommate and all participants, 
you would need to fetch the roommate data and cross-reference the IDs. */

/** (Child of App.jsx)

Renders when the route is /events.

Displays a list of events. Like RoomMates.jsx, it can be a simple standalone component for this project's scope. */
