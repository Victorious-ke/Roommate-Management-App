/* Purpose: The Home component will make GET requests to the endpoints to fetch and display summary information, 
such as the total number of pending chores or a list of roommates. */
/** Database Interaction:
GET /chores: To display an overview of chores on the homepage.
GET /roommates: To show the list of roommates. */

/** (Child of App.jsx)

Renders when the route is /.

It might have some simple children of its own, but for this project, it can be a standalone component. */
