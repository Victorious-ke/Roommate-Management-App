/** Purpose: This component would display a list of all the roommates, showing their names, avatars, 
 * and perhaps their email addresses. This component could also be part of a route, such as /roommates. 
 * This is useful for providing a central place to view all the users of the app. It would also be a 
 * good place to demonstrate a GET request. */

/** Database Interaction:
GET /roommates: This is the main endpoint for this component. It would fetch the list of all roommates. */

/** (Child of App.jsx)

Renders when the route is /roommates.

Displays a list of all roommates. It may contain a child component for a single roommate, but 
for this project, it can be a simple standalone component. */
